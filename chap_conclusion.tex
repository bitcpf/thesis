\section{Conclusion}


\section{Future Plan}
% Problem
In our previous work, we address the link communication spectrum adaptation, 
single hop access network deployment, and the multihop access network channel
assignment. Next, we are going to answer the question how to locate the mesh
network access nodes and gateways in multiband spectrum adaptation scenario.
The input of the problem is a target service area given with the parameters 
such as population distribution, spectrum usability, and FCC licensed channels, 
etc. The output is to locate the network infrastructure from the candidates.
Thus, the target area with pre-defined parameters could be modeled as a 
connectivity graph with vertices represented as the centralized traffic demand 
of a certain area and potential access points locations.
