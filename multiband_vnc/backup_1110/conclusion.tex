\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we investigated the multi-band adaption to leverage the propagation and context for vehicular utility. 
We did so by first testing and comparing the performance of different approaching multi-band selection algorithms. 
In our experimental analysis, we evaluated the performance of these algorithms on Gateworks hardware platform over in-field channels. 
Experimental results demonstrate that these algorithms can fit different utility environments. The accuracy of these algorithms can be up to 90.03%.
Since for mobile utility, energy is limited, in the future work we plan to consider the energy efficient in multi-band adaptation.
