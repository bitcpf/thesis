The emergence of the reapportioned white space bands for data usage will fuel the already
increasing frequency band diversity of today's wireless hardware. As a result, many
existing multi-channel and/or multi-band adaptation schemes will become more important.
Many of these works have considered the capacity and channel activity of these channels,
but have not distinguished between the propagation characteristics that occur when considering
a difference in frequency of multiple GHz and the resulting effect in various environments.
In this paper, we leverage the contextual information and propagation diversity to enable
adaptation across a number of frequency bands from 700 MHz to 5.8 GHz.  To do so, we
perform a number of experiments in a vehicular environment using a campus bus.  With a
model based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and an in-situ training set, we can predict
the throughput on a free channel.  We can then consider the activity level per band to 
compute the net throughput we should expect on a given band.  In the field, we exploit
the propgation differences experience per band to show that training on a repeatable 
route can yield vast performance improvements from prior schemes.  We show that minimal
amounts of training can provide such improvements and show a simple scheme that can allow
multiband adaptation gains when there is insufficient levels of training.
