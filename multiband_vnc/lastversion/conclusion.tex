\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we investigated the multiband adaptation to leverage the propagation and context for vehicular applications. 
We did so by proposing two machine-learning-based schemes and compared there
performance against two baseline schemes.
In our experimental analysis, we evaluated the performance of these algorithms 
in the field on an off-the-shelf platform.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can 
achieve up to 49.3\% greater throughput than the baseline algorithms
with an accuracy up to 65\%. Since for mobile networks have limited
energy, in future work we plan to examine the energy efficiency of
the simultaneous use of multiple, diverse radios.
