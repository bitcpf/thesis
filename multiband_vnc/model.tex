In this section, we first formulate the multiband 
adaptation problem in vehicular wireless links and introduce the set of information we use to make band decisions, which we refer to as context information. We then propose two machine-learning-based 
multiband adaptation algorithms for vehicular channels. For comparison, we also propose two baseline adaptation methods based on existing solutions which consider historical and instantaneous information independently.




\section{Link Adaptation Problem Formulation}
%The focus of this paper is on a context-based multiband adaptation algorithm as:
%The problem we are going to resolve is to find a band has the best throughput in multiple available options as:

Consider a system with~$n$ frequency bands, represented by an index set~$\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$. 
The objective is to select the optimal band,~$b_{best}$, to transmit at each time instant that maximizes a desired objective function such as throughput. The throughput~$r_i$ on band~$i$ depends on several factors such as received signal power~$P_R^i$, noise power~$P_N^i$, the channel activity level~$A^i$, the velocity of the transmitter,~$v_{tx}$,
 the velocity of the receiver,~$v_{rx}$, 
 and location information which depends on each algorithm and will be specified in the algorithm section. The aforementioned set of all information used to make multiband decisions composes the users context. 
 %Add Context
% Context is the information that can represent the characters of a wireless user.For mobile wireless users, velocity, RSSI, interference and location could be counted as context information.
This relationship is represented in general as~$r_i = f(P_R^i, P_N^i, A^i, v_{tx}, v_{rx}, $context information per algorithm$)$. The objective can be stated as:
\begin{equation}
b_{best}= \arg \max_i r_i 
\end{equation}
The framework differentiates interference from other nodes using the same technology (via the Activity level $A^i$) and other technologies (via the noise level~$P_N^i$). For instance, an 802.11 node can decode the packets of other 802.11 nodes but can only sense
instantaneous noise levels from ZigBee/Bluetooth nodes. 
Decoding the packets can provide increased knowledge such as 
data rate and packet size to determine the duration of the channel use.
%To help make decisions for multiband adaptation in a similar context,
We can exploit the long-term behavior by using historical performance
data for the collected context information
({\it e.g.}, $v_{tx}$, $v_{rx}$, $A^i$, $P_N^i$, $P_R^i$)~\cite{meikle2012global}. 
%can be used by people tending to have repeatable patterns
%~\cite{meikle2012global} and we could improve the performance with each trip 
%to the region if we could passively observe context along this repeatable 
%pattern. The variables used in each algorithm will be explained for each algorithm 
%later. 


%To represent the utilization level of the channel, we define \emph{activity level}, $A$,
%as the percentage of time when the channel is occupied by 
%all competing sources $x_j (j = 1, 2, 3, ...)$ other than the intended transmitter $y$. 
%For 802.11-based transmissions, the activity level on band $i$ is defined as:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eqn:80211activity}
%A^i = \frac{\sum_j{\sum_k{\frac{L_k^{x_j}}{R_k^{x_j}}}}}{\sum_k{\frac{L_k^y}{R_k^y}}+\sum_j{\sum_k{\frac{L_k^{x_j}}{R_k^{x_j}}}}+S\sigma}
%\end{equation}
%where $L_k^{x_j}$ and $R_k^{x_j}$ represent the packet length in bits and data
%rate at which that packet is transmitted, for external sources $x_j$;
%$S$ and $\sigma$ are the number of idle slots and slot duration, respectively. 
%When considering the activity level of non-802.11 users 
%({\it e.g.}, the bands currently licensed to TV),
%we use the received signal level from non-802.11 interfering sources $P_N^i$ 
%on band $i$ directly as an input to our algorithms. 

\section{Multiband Adaptation Algorithms}
\label{subsec:algorithms}

In order to evaluate the proposed multiband adaptation algorithms, 
we construct two baseline methods: (i.) We search for the
most commonly selected band as the best band in the historical data
and choose it as the final band decision. (ii.) For each band, we build 
a lookup table for throughput $T_{ideal}$ in an idealized channel given the $RSSI$ and obtain 
the best band according to following:
\begin{align}
&\max_i\ T_{ideal}^i\times(1-A^i),
\label{eq:baseline2}
\end{align}
The throughput $T_{ideal}$ is measured with an Azimuth ACE-MX channel emulator~\cite{AzimuthACE}. 
The details of the system setup and data collection are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:vncexperimentdesign}. 

Machine learning has been used as an important tool in wireless communications~\cite{haykin2005cognitive}. When a user enters an area, the machine
learning algorithm can learn from the historical data and
select the potential optimal band given the input, {\it e.g.}, $P_R^i$, $v$
and $P_N^i$. We propose two multiband adaptation algorithms based on
two machine learning methods: k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and decision trees.

%2 machine learning methods: 
%1. modified KNN, 

{\bf Location-based Look-up Algorithm.} KNN is a machine learning method
based on searching for the closest training data points in the feature space and various
modified versions have been applied successfully for classification~\cite{zhang2006svm}.
In the {\it Location-based Look-up Algorithm}, we search for the closest neighbors of 
a testing point by using each parameter one by one in the input set. 
The {\it Location-based Look-up Algorithm} additionally involves geographic information for band selection other than received signal power~$P_R^i$, noise power~$P_N^i$, the activity/occupancy level~$A^i$, the velocity of the transmitter,~$v_{tx}$.
The 
performance of the selected training data points is averaged to generate an estimate of the performance at each band. Then
the band with the highest throughput performance is selected as $b_{best}$.
%comparing with machine learning algorithms. 

For the {\it Location-based Look-up Algorithm}, 
context information involves the location $g$ (GPS latitude and longitude), $v$, $P_R^i$, $P_N^i$ 
and $A^i$. To make a band prediction, we have four look-up blocks to reduce
the training data points which are similar to the testing data point. First,
we search for the historical data which is closest to the testing data based on GPS location.
If the number of found historical data points is less than a predefined threshold, 
 $\theta_{AArea}$, we increase the distance range (the actual threshold is discussed in 
Section~\ref{sec:vncexperimentdesign}). Then, based on the filtered historical data,
we collect $\theta_{AArea}$ data points which are closest to $P_R^i$, where $\theta_{AArea}$ is the threshold of the number of collected data points. 
A similar process is repeated based on $P_N^i$ and $v$, respectively.
After deciding the final data set, we average the throughput of data points at each band.
This algorithm's key steps are shown in Algorithm~\ref{algorithms: Location}.

%2. region-based C4.5 (different region sizes)
{\bf Region-based Decision Tree Algorithm.} Decision trees are a  
widely-used machine learning 
algorithm due to their low complexity and stable performance~\cite{banfield2007}.
A decision tree can model the relationship in the training data between the context 
information and the optimal band as a set of tree-like deduction structures. Before 
implementing the training process, we prepare a training set including a group of 
training data points of $\{v_{tx}, v_{rx}, P_R^1, ..., P_R^n,  A^1, ..., A^n, P_N^1, 
..., P_N^n, b_{best}\}$ based on the collected measurements. We obtain $b_{best}$ by comparing
the throughput performance of all available bands and selecting the band with the highest 
throughput. We choose the C4.5 algorithm to generate our decision tree~\cite{hall2009weka}, a widely-used algorithm based on the 
information entropy gain. 

At each intermediate
node in the decision tree, the learning algorithm calculates the information entropy 
gain of splitting the remaining training data points based on each parameter in the input 
set, {\it e.g.}, $P_R^i$, $v$ or $P_N^i$. Then, it compares and selects the parameter with 
the highest entropy gain to decide the test condition at each intermediate node until 
all training data points are classified.  The leaf nodes indicate the optimal band for 
prediction in our application. Then, the trained decision structure is integrated into 
the transmitter protocol stack. With the collected context information, the decision 
structure can suggest the band with the best throughput performance. 

The relationship between the context information and the best band could differ at
different locations because of diverse propagation environment characteristics. 
To reduce the heterogeneity of training data from different locations, we split 
the vehicular route into several regions and implement the training process based 
on the historical data collected in each region. Then, the trained decision structure 
is integrated in our system for multiband adaptation in each region. The granularity 
of regional division is one parameter that affects the training set as well as the 
performance of the resulting decision tree. We 
evaluate the granularity of these divisions in Section~\ref{sec:vncexperimentdesign}.
