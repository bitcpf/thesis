\section{Summary}
\label{sec:vncsummary}


In this chapter, we investigated multiband adaptation to leverage the propagation and context for vehicular applications. 
We did so by proposing two machine-learning-based schemes and compared their
performance against two baseline schemes.
In our experimental analysis, we evaluated the performance of these algorithms 
in the field on an off-the-shelf platform.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can 
achieve up to 49.3\% greater throughput than the baseline algorithms
with an accuracy up to 65\%. In future work, we will study the impact that
multiple diverse environments have on the training as well as evaluate
the optimal use of multiple, diverse radios in unison.
%Since mobile networks have limited
%energy and training in multiple environment has not been investigated, in future work we plan to examine the influence of diverse environment and energy efficiency of
%the simultaneous use of multiple, diverse radios.
