\subsection{Performance Analysis of Algorithms}
\label{subsec:data process}

In the section \ref{sec:model}, we have introduced our algorithms for band adaptation. 
In this section, we investigate the metrics for evaluation and compare the proposed schemes with the data collected in
\ref{sec:experiment design}.

Throughput is the most important metric for any kind of networks and very sensitive to customers. In multi-band scenario, the object is to find the band has the best throughput.  
To investigate the performance, \emph{Accuracy} is used to represent the band estimation.
\emph{Accuracy} is defined as the percentages of predict best band match the measured best band.


\begin{align}
\label{equation:df accuracy}
Accuracy = \frac{Correct\ Prediction\ Slots}{All\ Predict\ Time\ Slots}
\end{align}

Due to the hardware characteristics, the throughput will be normalized across the bands to remove the divergence of the radios. Then the data will be divided into different subsets fit for the algorithms introduced in 
\ref{sec:model}.

%Ideal channel based process and accuracy computation
The \emph{SNR based Throughput Look up Algorithm} does not rely on the collected throughput performance and the environment. It fits for each data point with dynamic parameters.
This algorithm could be used in all data points and the \emph{Accuracy} can be counted through all the prediction and measured data.
%ML and LB algorithms process and accuracy computation
For \emph{Machine Learning Algorithm} and \emph{Location Based Algorithm}, the data set is divided in to training set and testing set has the same amount of data points.
The \emph{Accuracy} performance is counted as the correct prediction of the test set as defined in \ref{equation:df accuracy}. 
The performance of these algorithms is dependent on the amount of training set. In figure \ref{fig:performance} we show the variation of \emph{accuracy} of different amount of training set for these three algorithms.

The x-axis in figure \ref{fig:performance} is the number of loops the mobile node traveled through the park. 
The same testing set data is used for testing the \emph{Accuracy} performance.
\emph{SNR based Throughput Look up Algorithm} is independent to the training data, in \ref{fig:performance}, the \emph{Accuracy} performance is the same of all different loops.
\emph{Machine Learning Algorithm} curve in \ref{fig:performance} represents this algorithm is sensitive to the training data.
Only including the closest one or two loops can help to increase the accuracy. The class distribution of different loops would change and mix the training sets with different pattern of multiple loops without improving the accuracy performance.
\emph{Location based Look up Algorithm} has a performance improvement as the training data increase. The algorithm has the most strict conditions for each prediction, also has the best performance in these 3 algorithms when the training data is large enough.
The best performance of \emph{Location based Look up Algorithm} can go up to 60\%.


Also, the data set is divided into multiple regions to test the \emph{Split Region Machine Learning Algorithm}. There are 8 regions shown in \ref{fig:region map}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=85mm]{figure/region_map}
\caption{Split Regions}
\label{fig:region map}
\end{figure}

The \emph{Accuracy} performance of these 2 algorithms for the same training set and testing set is shown in figure \ref{fig:mvsl}

 
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=85mm]{figure/mvsl}
\caption{Performance in Different Regions of Split Region Machine Learning Algorithm and Location Based Look up Algorithm}
\label{fig:mvsl}
\end{figure}

In each regions, the training set for machine learning algorithm is fewer than group all of the data as a training set. 
The inner process of the decision is different from one region to another region.
In figure \ref{fig:mvsl}, most of the regions \emph{Location Based Look up Algorithm} has better performance than \emph{Split Region Machine Learning Algorithm}. 

We have investigated the performance of the algorithms in one experimental data set and shown the gains of them. Multi-band channels are complex system that knowing more information can make better decisions.

%\emph{Performance Improvement} is the percents of throughput of multi-band over single band.


%\subsubsection{Indoor Experiments} 
%We first use the signal level of test data in different band to calculate the signal level of different bands. Then we use the signal level database to predict the signal level. The results from the two methods are compared with the measured signal. The graph shows the calculation results, the context-aware results for fixme set of training data, and the measured results.

%The amount of information in context-aware database will influence the accuracy of results. How much information is enough for the prediction for the signal is an interesting question. We put the same test data into different size context-aware database to produce the output signal level in different bands. The graph shows the signal level prediction in different context-aware database and the measured results.

%Parsing script
%In our experiments, we are constantly collecting large amounts of data, including the received signal level, current location, velocity, and time of day. Working with the memory-limited Gateworks boards, it became necessary to implement a solution to collect large amounts of data without exhausting the available memory space on the boards. Thus, we compiled a script to parse an undetermined number of data files containing the raw data collected from the ongoing experiments. Utilizing the Perl programming language, which the Gateworks boards are capable of running, the script scans every file in a directory we specify and parses them, looking specifically for signal level, lat/long location, velocity, and time data recorded from the experiments. Upon finding this information, the script reformats the data by placing it into a .csv file. Additionally, using the location data, the script calculates the  distance between the transmitting and receiving boards and adds this information to the .csv file. Upon parsing the data, the raw experimental data files can simply be delete from memory, freeing up space for the data of subsequent experiments.

%Activity monitor script
%For in-situ experiments, the need became apparent to track the number of new incoming packets and compare it with the number of previously received packets. Additionally, this needed to be done for each of the four wireless radios on the board. In doing this, we identify the most efficient frequency band to transmit data. To implement this system, a script was needed to run efficiently in the background while experiments were taking place. To achieve this, we wrote a bash shell script to run directly on the board without relying on any higher level programming language that could potentially cause greater performance overhead. As a result, the script only consumes one to two percent of CPU resource. The script begins by examining the received bytes across each radio for a length of 30 seconds and placing the bytes received each second on a new line in a file. Upon the completion of the 30 second buffering time period, the next second of received bytes on each radio is read and compared with the last 30 seconds of received data. This ratio of the most recent received data to old received data is then calculated and written to four files, one for each radio, for its subsequent use in selecting which radio to transmit/receive from.
