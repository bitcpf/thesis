\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:introduction}


The main contributions of our work are as follows:
\begin{itemize}

\item Understand the role of propagation on multiband information via the use of context information.
\item Evaluating the amount of training necessary for gains in multiband adaptation.
\item Leverage path loss estimation in a particular environment when there is insufficient contextual training
to produce gains.
\item Verify the framework through emulated, indoor, and in-field experimental trials.
\end{itemize}
