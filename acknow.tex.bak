One of the great joys of completion is to look over the journey past and remember
all the friends and family who have helped and supported me along this long but 
fulfilling road. 

First and formost, I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Joseph Camp, who 
provided seemingly endless resources to support my work. I would also like to thank 
my co-advisor, Dr. Dinesh Rajan, who always provides great comments and suggestions on 
my research, presentations and publications. They are not only my academic mentors but 
also model examples of 'American Dream' I can touch. 
I could not have asked for better role models, each inspirational, supportive, and  
patient. 
I would not be where I am today without the time and effort you spent throughout my 
studies. 
Thanks also go to my other committee member, Dr. Panos Papamichalis, 
Dr. Carlos Davila, Dr. Eli Olinick, for providing novel perspectives to my work.

Special thanks to Dr. Joseph Cleveland, who offered several courses and always joined in 
our group discussion. Thanks to Buses By Bill Inc. and Bill Austin for their supports of 
our measurements system.

I am thankful for the collaborations and discussions within our research group, 
including Yongjiu Du, Jonathan Landon, Pengda Huang, Hui Liu, Jialin He, Matthew Tonnemacher, 
Eric Johnson, Yingsi Liang, Rita Enami, Bryan Jeon and Tiaotiao Wang. I am thinkful for collaboration 
with Jialin He, Hui Liu, Jonathan Landon, Dr. Onur Altintas, Rama Vuyyuru, 
Yuanyuan Dong, Dr. Eli Olinick, Dr. Ehsan Aryafa, and Dr. Mung Chiang.

I would like to thank my friends, Yu Gan, Fujun Liu, Jinyang Liang, Junjie Ma, Ting Li,
Wei Liu and Dr. Silin Wang for their help and encouraging for my Ph.D studies.


I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my wife, Yulin Wang. Without her love, 
support, patience and help, I would not overcome the hard times throughout my Ph.D studies.


I am indebted to my family, especially to my mother and father, for 
believing in me to complete this work.

Last, but not least, thanks to all people participate in our experiments.
